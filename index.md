# QmMote
## What is QmMote?
QmMote is an interpreter for [the Emoticon language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Emoticon).
## Where can I get QmMote?
[Here](https://github.com/benjidial/QmMote/releases/latest) is the latest stable release. If you want to compile the very latest stable(ish) code for yourself, you can install [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) and [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), download [this archive](https://github.com/benjidial/QmMote/archive/master.zip), extract the files and run `make`.
## How do I use QmMote?
Program source is read from stdin. This means you can simply run `QmMote` and type your program code in. If you have your code in a file, you can pipe its contents into QmMote. In UNIX-like systems, this is done with `QmMote < myfile`.
## Can I reuse QmMote?
Yes! QmMote uses [the Unlicense](https://www.unlicense.org). Stable source is available [here](https://github.com/benjidial/QmMote) and expiremental source [here](https://github.com/benjidial/QmMote/tree/dev).
